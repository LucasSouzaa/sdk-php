## Introduction ##

This **PHP** library allows for easy integration with the **maxiPago! Smart Payments** platform (<www.maxipago.com>). In order to send requests you will need valid credentials, which can be obtained from our Customer Support team at support [@] maxipago [.] com.

If you'd like to get a more comprehensive view of our API you can check our full documentation at <http://www.maxipago.com/docs/maxiPago_API_Latest.pdf>.

 
## Installation ##

Installation is pretty straightforward: simply copy the **maxipago_payment.php** file from this repository to your server.

To include use the following code:

		include_once "maxipago_payment.php";


## Environment and Credentials ##

**maxiPago!** provides a fully functional test environment to simulate the transaction responses. You need to set the environment variable so the library knows to which environment to send the transaction to.

The environment can be set by defining the target URL of the request:

		define("url", "https://www.url.com");

You also need to provide your Merchant Credentials, which uniquely identify your business inside our platform. This is done by setting the **$credentials** array, as shown below:

		$credentials = array("merchantId" => "100", "merchantKey" => "secret-key");


## Available transaction types ##

* **Authorization:** checks if the credit card used is valid (number, security code and expiration date) and if the card holder has sufficient funds for that purchase.

* **Capture:** confirms the authorization previously made and completes the transaction. If the transaction is never captured the Merchant does not receive the funds and the Card Holder is never charged.

>*Separating the authorization and capture is an excellent way to check your stock for the purchase items or doing a fraud analysis while guaranteeing the payment.*

* **Sale:** combines the authorization and the capture in a single request. When performing a Sale we send the credit card for authorization and immediately captures that transaction, if approved.

* **Void:** cancels the transaction and no money is charged from the buyer. You can only void a transaction until 11:59pm of the day of capture.

* **Returns:** reverses a credit card transaction, taking funds from the Merchant and giving them back to the buyer. This is a financial operation that might take a few days to be completed, depending on your credit card processor.

* **Recurring:** schedules a credit card transaction to be charged at a specific interval, defined by the Merchant.

* **Card On File:** saves a card in our system and returns a unique token, which can be used to process future transactions. It's an excellent way to implement "single-click" payments.

* **Boleto:** Brazil only. Transactions made with Boletos are different than credit card purchases. This creates a boleto and returns an URL to the buyer to access the boleto payment slip. It can be accessed at any time before the boleto expiration and until 60 days after it has expired.
